Machine Learning for Rheumatoid Arthritis Infection Risk with b/ts DMARDs
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting infection risk in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs (b/ts DMARDs). The project aims to use predictive modeling to identify risk factors and support clinical decision-making.
